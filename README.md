So feel free and welcome to stay with us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |within an hour    |100%              |67%                 |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2238496/profile_pic/1335559927/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                           |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2238496/profile_pic/1335559927/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                           |                  |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands|Bezuidenhout-Midden   |Wijk 26 Bezuidenhout              |52.08399        |4.33062          |Entire rental unit       |Entire home/apt|3           |         |1.5 baths       |        |1   |[]       |$150.00|1             |24            |1                     |1                     |24                    |24                    |1.0                   |24.0                  |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |195             |2023-12-23           |127              |2                    |0                     |2012-06-04  |2023-10-23 |4.79                |4.79                  |4.79                     |4.89                 |4.82                       |4.96                  |4.81               |0518 2B37 5D9E E68B 7E90|f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.90             |

I really enjoy the Netherlands as my adopted home country and have no plans to return to the US other than for visits.  On a personal level, I have three daughters 25 , 30 and 44 with the two youngest growing up in the Netherlands and attending Dutch schools.   Two of the three lived in the US : Washington DC and New York ( but now Marseille)    My 30 year old moved first back to Holland 8 years ago , then Brussels and now Helsinki and is active in the environmental movement .  My oldest owns a home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn ( now living in Marseille) and founded an environmental NGO 14+ years ago ( Human Impacts Institute) and has a  5 year old daughter.  Lastly my youngest moved to DC 2 years ago after graduating 5 years ago from College of Charleston with high honors in International relations and political science.   You wouldn't be wrong to deduce that I'm quite proud of these three lovely ladies.  As for myself, I have traveled a lot over the last 40 + years for both work and pleasure and really enjoy meeting people so when I first heard of Airbnb almost 13  years ago, the concept of Airbnb appealed to me.  On a personal level, I have had an interesting career in high-tech international sales management. In my pleasure time I have quite varied interests but I am very much an outdoors person. I enjoy sailing, tennis, biking, camping, skiing etc. and I am as well a classical musician and a world class tournament bridge player.   I have always loved to travel and meet people and have been doing just that since my teenage years when I hitchhiked with hair to my waist, a biker jacket and a backpack from Washington DC to San Francisco in the middle of the Hippy Era 1971 . ... can't say I regret it !!  Back to the present:   I renovated my 3 bedroom flat in Centrum Den Haag 15 years ago when my two then teenage daughters still lived in the Netherlands and spent weekends with me.   I then set up the two small bedrooms in my 3 bedroom flat with bunk beds to accomodate friends staying over.  Before I began hosting through Airbnb,  I occasionally rented  out a room to interns/foreign students and now have been hosting for the last 12 years through Airbnb.   Hosting with Airbnb has been overall a very interesting and rewarding experience.   I have found almost without exception my Airbnb guests from all over the world and from very differing backgrounds to be very interesting , considerate and nice to be around.  As you are now reading my profile, I hope that you will consider staying at my flat and I  look forward to welcoming you to my home and my adopted city of Den Haag.

De gastvrijheid, het persoonlijke contact en de kleinschaligheid heeft mij altijd aangetrokken.  Toen ik mijn appartement in Benoordenhout betrok, ben ik naar dit idee mijn eigen B & B gestart.  Ik heb een eigen atelier, waar ik werk aan schilderopdrachten. Ik luister veel naar muziek, speel piano en zing in koren.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |within an hour    |100%              |71%                 |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3206829/profile_pic/1393258761/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                           |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3206829/profile_pic/1393258761/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                           |                  |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands|Duinzigt              |Wijk 04 Benoordenhout             |52.10292        |4.32035          |Entire rental unit       |Entire home/apt|2           |         |1.5 baths       |        |1   |[]       |$80.00 |2             |30            |2                     |5                     |30                    |30                    |2.4                   |30.0                  |                |t               |15             |40             |66             |326             |2023-12-23           |259              |11                   |0                     |2013-07-02  |2023-07-31 |4.59                |4.75                  |4.88                     |4.87                 |4.86                       |4.64                  |4.53               |0518 39C4 1D10 992B 8F94|f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |2.03             |

I really enjoy the Netherlands as my adopted home country and have no plans to return to the US other than for visits.  On a personal level, I have three daughters 25 , 30 and 44 with the two youngest growing up in the Netherlands and attending Dutch schools.   Two of the three lived in the US : Washington DC and New York ( but now Marseille)    My 30 year old moved first back to Holland 8 years ago , then Brussels and now Helsinki and is active in the environmental movement .  My oldest owns a home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn ( now living in Marseille) and founded an environmental NGO 14+ years ago ( Human Impacts Institute) and has a  5 year old daughter.  Lastly my youngest moved to DC 2 years ago after graduating 5 years ago from College of Charleston with high honors in International relations and political science.   You wouldn't be wrong to deduce that I'm quite proud of these three lovely ladies.  As for myself, I have traveled a lot over the last 40 + years for both work and pleasure and really enjoy meeting people so when I first heard of Airbnb almost 13  years ago, the concept of Airbnb appealed to me.  On a personal level, I have had an interesting career in high-tech international sales management. In my pleasure time I have quite varied interests but I am very much an outdoors person. I enjoy sailing, tennis, biking, camping, skiing etc. and I am as well a classical musician and a world class tournament bridge player.   I have always loved to travel and meet people and have been doing just that since my teenage years when I hitchhiked with hair to my waist, a biker jacket and a backpack from Washington DC to San Francisco in the middle of the Hippy Era 1971 . ... can't say I regret it !!  Back to the present:   I renovated my 3 bedroom flat in Centrum Den Haag 15 years ago when my two then teenage daughters still lived in the Netherlands and spent weekends with me.   I then set up the two small bedrooms in my 3 bedroom flat with bunk beds to accomodate friends staying over.  Before I began hosting through Airbnb,  I occasionally rented  out a room to interns/foreign students and now have been hosting for the last 12 years through Airbnb.   Hosting with Airbnb has been overall a very interesting and rewarding experience.   I have found almost without exception my Airbnb guests from all over the world and from very differing backgrounds to be very interesting , considerate and nice to be around.  As you are now reading my profile, I hope that you will consider staying at my flat and I  look forward to welcoming you to my home and my adopted city of Den Haag.

Helping them to have a great holiday in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |within an hour    |100%              |83%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0260d46e-c3f8-432e-9156-d34a321800e5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                      |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0260d46e-c3f8-432e-9156-d34a321800e5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                      |                  |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands|Kortenbos             |Wijk 28 Centrum                   |52.07683        |4.30513          |Entire loft              |Entire home/apt|4           |         |1 bath          |        |4   |[]       |$149.00|4             |30            |2                     |4                     |30                    |30                    |3.9                   |30.0                  |                |t               |20             |30             |33             |33              |2023-12-23           |286              |28                   |3                     |2013-07-02  |2023-12-18 |4.89                |4.93                  |4.94                     |4.95                 |4.97                       |4.97                  |4.85               |0518 4400 8D84 9B73 CB39|f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |2.24             |

Welcome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |within an hour    |100%              |99%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-300966/original/aafe6d84-e2c2-4db6-8952-57c95748e3e9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-300966/original/aafe6d84-e2c2-4db6-8952-57c95748e3e9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium|                  |20                 |22                       |['email', 'phone', 'work_email']|t                   |t                     |Den Haag, South Holland, Netherlands |Huygenspark           |Wijk 27 Stationsbuurt             |52.07137        |4.32465          |Entire rental unit       |Entire home/apt|2           |         |1 bath          |        |1   |[]       |$177.00|1             |1125          |1                     |1                     |1125                  |1125                  |1.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |0               |2023-12-23           |411              |86                   |6                     |2013-06-15  |2023-12-17 |4.67                |4.75                  |4.63                     |4.71                 |4.74                       |4.7                   |4.6                |Exempt                  |t               |20                            |20                                         |0                                           |0                                          |3.21             |

When scrubbing the data, I found that there were way too many columns with way too much information than could be reasonably included in the table. Many columsn were unnecessary when performing the analysis I was going to perform. Therefore, I only kept tables I believed would be relevant to the analysis. The tables I kept were "id", "source", "name", "description", "host_id", "host_name", "host_since", "host_location", "host_response_rate", "host_acceptance_rate", "host_is_superhost", "host_total_listings_count", "neighborhood", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed", "latitude", "longitude", "property_type", "room_type", "accommodates", "beds", "price", "minimum_nights", "maximum_nights", "number_of_reviews", and "review_scores_rating". I did this by creating a basic python script that would filter out the irrelevant columns.

### Q3

choose two hosts (by reffering to their host_id values) who are superhosts (available in the host_is_superhost field), and show all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts

db.listings.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            $or: [
                { host_id: 4817186}, 
                { host_id: 300966}]
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            _id: 0,
            name: 1,
            price: 1,
            neighborhood: 1,
            host_name: 1,
            host_is_superhost: 1
        }
    }
])

[
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Den Haag · ★4.70 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_name: 'Elwin',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighborhood: '',
    price: '$219.00'
  },
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Den Haag · ★4.65 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_name: 'Elwin',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighborhood: '',
    price: '$223.00'
  },
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Den Haag · ★4.57 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath',
    host_name: 'Elwin',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighborhood: '',
    price: '$272.00'
  },
]

While both Elwin and Yolande are superhosts, Elwin appears to have many more properties than Yolande.

### Q4

find all the unique host_name values 

db.listings_new2.distinct("host_name")

[
  'Aad',
  'Adam',
  'Adriaan',
]

There are many, many different host names with some but not a lot of overlap.

### Q5

find all of the places that have more than 2 beds in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as either the neighborhood or neighbourhood_group_cleansed fields in the data file), ordered by review_scores_rating descending.

db.listings.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            beds: { $gt: 2 }, 
            neighbourhood_group_cleansed: { $regex: /Wijk 28 Centrum/i } 
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: { review_scores_rating: -1 } 
    },
    {
        $project: {
            _id: 0,
            name: 1,
            beds: 1,
            review_scores_rating: 1,
            price: 1
        }
    }
])

[
  {
    name: 'Townhouse in Den Haag · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 3.5 baths',
    beds: 3,
    price: '$295.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    name: 'Condo in Den Haag · 2 bedrooms · 4 beds · 2 baths',
    beds: 4,
    price: '$200.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Den Haag · ★New · 2 bedrooms · 3 beds · 1 bath',
    beds: 3,
    price: '$185.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  }
]

More houses in Wijk 28 Centrum are marked as from Den Haag than The Hague. In addition, the price range for places with more than 2 beds is around $150-300

### Q6

show the number of listings per host

db.listings.aggregate([
 {$group: {
  _id: "$host_id",
  listingCount: {$sum: 1}
  }}
])

[
  { _id: 5033611, listingCount: 1 },
  { _id: 360831279, listingCount: 1 },
  { _id: 43275373, listingCount: 1 },
]

### Q7

find the average review_scores_rating per neighborhood, and only show those that are 4 or above, sorted in descending order of rating

db.listings.aggregate([
    {$group: {
        _id: "$neighbourhood_group_cleansed",
        averageRating: { $avg: "$review_scores_rating" }
    }}, 
    {
	    $match: { averageRating: { $gt: 4 } }
    }, 
    {
	    $sort: { averageRating: -1 }
    }
])

[
  { _id: 'Wijk 41 Hoornwijk', averageRating: 5 },
  { _id: 'Wijk 10 Zorgvliet', averageRating: 5 },
  { _id: 'Wijk 32 Leyenburg', averageRating: 5 },
]
